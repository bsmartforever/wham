CF_EDIT is a powerful GUI-based tool to examine, combine, and
manipulate the IDF files produced by CalFUSE.  To install it on
your machine, follow these instructions.


1) Install the IDL Astronomy User's Library, available here:

http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/homepage.html


2) Install the latest version (February 2007) of Don Lindler's
ltools package:

http://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/analysis/fuse_idl_tools.html


3) System variables required for running the FUSE software are
defined in the idl_startup.pro file in this directory.  To make it
the default version for your IDL session, add a line similar to the
following to your .cshrc file:

setenv IDL_STARTUP /my_disk/idl/pro/ltools_022007/idl_startup.pro

Or just copy the relevant lines into your current IDL_STARTUP file.


4) If CalFUSE is installed on your machine, define the CF_CALDIR
environment variable before starting up IDL:

> setenv CF_CALDIR  [calfuse_directory]/v3.2/calfiles


5) Fire up IDL and run cf_edit.

> idl
> cf_edit

For complete instructions, please see the user's manual for CF_EDIT,
which is in this directory.


6) If IDL is not installed on your machine, you can run the "Virtual
Machine" version of the program, cf_edit.sav, also found in this
directory.  You must first install the IDL Virtual Machine software.
