See below for the website for installation directions. Note that I get an error message when I try to do this. 

XIDL package
Built and distributed by Jason X. Prochaska
Public tarball version located here: Lick
If you wish to modify the code yourself, I highly recommend you contact me about accessing the CVS distribution.
Installing...
Copy the package into $HOMEIDL_DIR
Unpack the distribution (unpacks into xidl/) and enter the directory
prompt> gtar -zxvf xidl.tar.gz

prompt> cd xidl/

Clean the directories
prompt> bin/evilmake clean

Run the make file (this should detect your operating system):
prompt> bin/evilmake

Updating
Simply grab the new tar file, unpack anew and rerun 'bin/evilmake' and 'bin/evilmake clean'
WARNING: This will overwrite any changes you have made to these codes!!! Use the CVS distribution to avoid this (contact me)
