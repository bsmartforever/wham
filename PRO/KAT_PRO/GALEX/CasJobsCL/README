Compilation --------

    'ant' to build

Building Stubs ---------

to build the tablejobs stub...

java org.apache.axis.wsdl.WSDL2Java http://localhost/casjobs/tablejobs.asmx?wsdl

to build the casjobs.asmx stub...

votable messes this all up.  you need to edit the wsdl.
first download and save the wsdl (casjobs.asmx?wsdl)
then delete all references to VOTable, including method calls with votable in their name.
then build the stubs from the modified wsdl.

the stub url fields also need to be changed from private to public.
one is here... TableJobsLocator.TableJobsSoap_address
the other is here...  CasJobsLocator.CasJobsSoap_address

copy the stubs over to the appropriate ./src directory, then delete build, then rebuild.


Building the Jar ---

    'ant dist' will build a jar and zip up the src directory. 

    one of the libraries has a partially signed certificate that causes problems in the jar.
    you need to edit the jar to fix this.
    open it up in a package viewer (winzip/winrar, etc)

    delete all

    META-INF\SUN_MICR*

    save (repackage)
