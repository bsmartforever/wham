The following routines have been modified from the original
FORTRAN program FIVEL.F written by de Robertis, Dufour, & Hunt
and obtained from Don Garnett on 4/2004.  Major changes include
(1) removal of common blocks; (2) implicit none adopted; 
(3) double precision and long integers used throughout; 
(4) complete documentation; (5) input/output generalized.

	im_input
	im_output
	im_pari
	im_parii
	im_solve
	im_temden

The following routines are modified versions of the im_* routines
listed above.  They have been altered (primarily in terms of I/O)
to be used with the call_external function in IM_FIVEL.PRO.
