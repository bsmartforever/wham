; NAME:
;	READFAST
;
; PURPOSE:
;	Routine to read in column-formated data very quickly.
;
; INPUTS:
;	filename - name of the file to be read
;
; OPTIONAL INPUTS:
;	skipline - number of lines to skip at the top of the file
;	
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;	double - optionally read the data in as double precision
;
; OUTPUTS:
;	data - floating point 2D array containing the columns and rows
;              in the data file
;
; OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
;	header - string array containing the lines skipped at the
;                beginning of the file
;	ncols  - number of columns read
;	nlines - number of lines read
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;	None.
;
; COMMENTS: 
;	This program will only read floating (or double) precision
;	data, and the file must be column-formated.  It will read in
;	hundreds of thousands of lines in a matter of seconds after
;	determining how many lines and columns there are in the file.
;	Note that the program will not skip blank lines nor comment
;	lines unless explicitly told to do so with the skipline
;	option.  The idea is speed over flexibility. 
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;	John Moustakas, 2000 May 24, UC Berkeley
;	jm01jan16uofa - added nlines keyword to optionally return the
;                       number of lines in the file; added error
;                       checking 
;	jm01jan25uofa - routine figures out how many columns there are
;                       in the file; added double keyword; documented,
;                       cleaned up, and optimized
