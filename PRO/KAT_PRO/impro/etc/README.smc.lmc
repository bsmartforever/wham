Subject: Re: smc & lmc extinction curves

Hi John,
   I don't have a parameterized version (although that is a good idea).  I do 
have new tabulated versions (with data from UV to NIR) of the SMC Bar, LMC2, and 
LMC Average extinction curves (as defined in Gordon & Clayton 1998 and Misselt, 
Clayton, & Gordon 1999).  They are part of a *new* paper which is in the 
refereeing process which will be Gordon et al. (2003).  I've attached the files 
to this email for your enjoyment.

Cheers,
Karl.
